    <p>
      I’ve been lucky to take part in some amazing races and training seasons, but one moment that really stands out was being selected to represent my high school’s cross country team at the 2020 State Meet. That experience was unforgettable, and it made all the hard work feel worth it.
      <br><br>
      Of course, it hasn’t all been easy. There have been setbacks—injuries, tough workouts, and times when I wanted to give up—but those moments taught me how to stay focused and push forward. Running continues to be a source of motivation, and I’m excited to keep improving.
