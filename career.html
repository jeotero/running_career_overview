    <p>
      Throughout my running career, I’ve had the opportunity to explore many different distances and events. I’ve competed in middle-distance races like the 800m and 1500m, as well as longer efforts like the 5k and 4k cross-country meets. Each distance brings a unique challenge and has helped me become a stronger, smarter athlete. I’ve spent years focusing on improving my endurance, form, and mental strength. What I love most about running is that it rewards consistency. Even when I don’t feel my best, I show up and put in the work, and the progress always follows. The lessons I’ve learned through racing, like resilience, pacing, and patience, apply to much more than just sports.

      Of course, it hasn’t all been easy. There have been setbacks—injuries, tough workouts, and times when I wanted to give up—but those moments taught me how to stay focused and push forward. Running continues to be a source of motivation, and I’m excited to keep improving.
