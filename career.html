      Throughout my running career, I’ve had the opportunity to explore many different distances and events. I’ve competed in middle-distance races like the 800m and 1500m, as well as longer efforts like the 5k and 4k cross-country meets. Each distance brings a unique challenge and has helped me become a stronger, smarter athlete. I’ve spent years focusing on improving my endurance, form, and mental strength. What I love most about running is that it rewards consistency. Even when I don’t feel my best, I show up and put in the work, and the progress always follows. The lessons I’ve learned through racing, like resilience, pacing, and patience, apply to much more than just sports.

      I’m especially proud of the personal bests I’ve achieved, not because of the numbers themselves, but because of what they represent. Every one of these times is the result of hard work, setbacks, small wins, and countless miles. I’ve also become a bit of a gear enthusiast along the way. My go-to running shoes are from New Balance. They’ve given me the right balance of comfort and performance through training and races. I look forward to seeing how far I can go in the years to come. Here are some of the personal highlights I’m most proud of:
