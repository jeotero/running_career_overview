      Hello! My name is Jesus, and Iâ€™ve been passionate about running since I was 10 years old. What started as a simple after-school activity quickly turned into a defining part of who I am. I still remember the thrill of one of my first races, the nervous excitement before the starting gun, and the rush of adrenaline as I pushed myself toward the finish line. As I grew older, running evolved from something fun into a discipline that taught me dedication, perseverance, and patience. Early morning runs, long weekend miles, and structured training schedules became part of my routine. Running has helped me manage stress, build confidence, and stay focused.

      One of the most memorable and meaningful moments of my running journey was when I was selected to represent my high school in the 2020 state cross country meet. It was an incredible honor and a huge milestone for me. That experience reminded me that progress is often slow and steady, and that commitment truly pays off. Running has brought me confidence, structure, and joy. It has taught me to set goals, overcome challenges, and enjoy the journey just as much as the results. I created this website to reflect on that journey and to share what running means to me.
