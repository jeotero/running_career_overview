      Hi! I'm <strong>Jesus</strong>, and I've been passionate about running since I was 10 years old. What started as a fun way to stay active quickly turned into something much more meaningful to me.
      <br><br>
      Running has helped me grow, both physically and mentally. From early morning practices to tough races in the rain, each experience has taught me something new. I’ve had the chance to meet incredible teammates, push through personal limits, and celebrate moments of real pride.
      <br><br>
      This site is just a glimpse into the journey I’ve had as a runner so far. Thanks for stopping by—I hope you enjoy reading about it!
